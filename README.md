# Pytool Package

helper methods and classes that make life easier or fill in gaps in the
Python Standard Library.

Pytool is compatible with and tested against Python 3.8 and higher. End of life Python versions are not supported.

> [!NOTE] > _Note_: Python 2 and `<3.8` is now [End of
> Life](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) and support in Pytool
> is deprecated and will be removed in Pytool 4.x.

Pytool's source is hosted on Github: <https://github.com/shakefu/pytool>
