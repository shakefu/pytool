    Return `text` wrapped to `width` while trimming leading indentation and
    preserving paragraphs.

    This function is handy for turning indented inline strings into unindented
    strings that preserve paragraphs, whitespace, and any indentation beyond
    the baseline.

                        line which is hard wrapped at a random character width,
                        but will be wrapped appropriately at 70 chars
                        afterwards.
