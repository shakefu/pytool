This module contains helpers for working with JSON data.

Tries to use the `simplejson` module if it exists, otherwise falls back to the
`json` module.

If the `bson` module exists, it allows `bson.ObjectId` objects to be decoded
into JSON automatically.

    Returns an object JSON encoded properly.

    This method allows you to implement a hook method ``for_json()`` on your
    objects if you want to allow arbitrary objects to be encoded to JSON. A
    ``for_json()`` hook must return a basic JSON type (dict, list, int, float,
    string, unicode, float or None), or a basic JSON type which contains other
    objects which implement the ``for_json()`` hook.

    If an object implements both ``_asdict()`` and ``for_json()`` the latter is
    given preference.

    Also adds additional encoders for :class:`~datetime.datetime` and
    :class:`bson.ObjectId`.

    :param **kwargs: Any optional keyword arguments to pass to the \
                       JSONEncoder
    :returns: JSON encoded version of `obj`.

    .. versionadded:: 2.4
       Objects which have an ``_asdict()`` method will have that method
       called as part of encoding to JSON, even when not using simplejson.

    .. versionadded:: 2.4
       Objects which have a ``for_json()`` method will have that method called
       and the return value used for encoding instead.

    .. versionchanged:: 3.0
       simplejson (``>= 3.2.0``) is now required, and relied upon for the
       ``_asdict()`` and ``for_json()`` hooks. This change may break backwards
       compatibility in any code that uses these hooks.
