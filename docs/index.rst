Pytool - Helpers for Python
===========================

Pytool is a Python helper package that contains a lot of helpful little methods
and functions to make your life a little easier and your day a little better.
Enjoy! These include:

* Command helpers for easily making CLI tools based on :mod:`argparse`
* Language helpers which implement common Python language constructs like
  singletons, namespace objects, class properties, and proxy objects
* Time helpers for easily working with UTC, relative times, and converting
  between formats
* Text helpers to respect console width when wrapping and printing
* JSON helpers for easily parsing and serializing JSON with customization
* ... and more!

Pytool is compatible with Python 3.10 and higher.  Older versions of Python are
no longer supported going forward. If you need support for earlier Python
versions, please check the `releases
<https://github.com/shakefu/pytool/releases>`_ for older versions of Pytool.
*Compatibility updated June 9, 2025.*
